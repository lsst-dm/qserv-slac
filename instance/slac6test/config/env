# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2023-11-06: changes to the configuration of all 15 nodes of the Qserv
#             cluster.
#
# The default location of the core dumps on the RHEL8 filesystem is at
#
#  CORE_DUMPS=/var/lib/systemd/coredump
#
# The files are stored here in the lz4 compressed format by the system
# as configured by
#
# % cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
#   |/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-coredump %P %u %g %s %t %c %h %e
#
# This service has the following configuration
#
# % cat /etc/systemd/coredump.conf
# [Coredump]
# #Storage=external
# #Compress=yes
# #ProcessSizeMax=2G
# #ExternalSizeMax=2G
# #JournalSizeMax=767M
# #MaxUse=
# #KeepFree=
#
# There are a few problems with this configuration:
#   - limited capacity (a few GB of the destinaton folder which is mounted
#     to the root filesystem of a host)
#   - the files are owned by user 'root'
#   - the files are truncated at 2GB (which is way to low for Qserv processes)
#
# The following solution was applied at each node of the cluster:
#
# mkdir -p /zfspool/core-files
# chmod a+rwx /zfspool/core-files
# echo '/zfspool/core-files/core.%e.%p.%h.%t' > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
#
# And the new location of the files is specified below:

CORE_DUMPS=/zfspool/core-files
